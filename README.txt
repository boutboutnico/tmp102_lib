DESCRIPTION
The TMP102 is a two-wire, serial output temperature 
sensor available in a tiny SOT563 package. Requiring
no external components, the TMP102 is capable of 
10mA Active (max) reading temperatures to a resolution of 0.0625°C.

The TMP102 features SMBus and two-wire interface
compatibility, and allows up to four devices on one
bus. It also features an SMB alert function.

The TMP102 is ideal for extended temperature 
measurement in a variety of communication,
computer, consumer, environmental, industrial, and
instrumentation applications. The device is specified
for operation over a temperature range of –40°C to +125°C.
